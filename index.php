        We hope to foster a welcoming and inclusive community within ECE. Be
        respectful to those on the server. Act with integrity and
        professionalism. To help achieve these goals, here are some guidelines:
        <br>
      </span>
      <ol>
        <li><span style="font-family: Open Sans;"> Bullying, harassment, sexism,
            or hate speech of any kind are not tolerated on this server.<br>

        <li><span style="font-family: Open Sans;"> Be mindful of academic
            dishonesty policies of different classes. <br>
            <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Open Sans;"> No spamming. (Use pastebin or
            alternative for long text) <br>
            <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Open Sans;"> Never post other's personal

            <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Open Sans;"> Don't mention what classes
            another person is in unless they already have the role for the class
            publicly visible. <br>
            <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Open Sans;"> Never post confidential or

            details and confidential information, either. <br>
            <br>
          </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Open Sans;">Violating any of these rules
